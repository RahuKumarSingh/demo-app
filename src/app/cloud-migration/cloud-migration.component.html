            Migrating to the Cloud has been a rising trend among organisations
            looking to go global and become more agile. Moving data from
            on-premises to the cloud can seem daunting or easy depending on how
            you see it. However the fact is that like all the other things on
            the internet, cloud migration has its benefits and risks. Therefore
            it's essential to know what you are in for before taking the plunge.
            I will be highlighting and explaining the benefits, challenges and
            solutions to cloud migration and how we, at Ecomm India Cloud IT
            strive to make the transition a breeze for you.
          </p>
          <h5>Benifits</h5>
          <p class="card-text">
            A lot of factors can make cloud migration a necessity rather than a
            choice. An organisation may have to turn to the cloud because of
            increasing traffic to their applications & websites, expanding the
            company geographically or for growing the core IT infrastructure
            stack.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            For many, migration to the cloud has been an extremely succesful
            business decision despite the initial apprehensions. Moving to the
            cloud has some significant benefits.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            <b>• Flexibility - </b>Starting up new servers, adding tons of
            storage, removing unwanted resources etc. is very flexible with the
            cloud i.e. it can scale up and down depending on the needs of the
            business very easily as compared to its onsite rivals. Remote or
            public cloud infrastructure is very agile without any of the
            constrains that come with setting your own physical IT
            infrastructure.
          </p>

          <p class="card-text">
            <b>• Disaster recovery - </b>Cloud systems win hands down in this
            area over their traditional counterparts. Disaster recovery systems
            on the cloud are cheaper, easier to set up and give much more
            control. Setting up a disaster recovery system onsite on physical
            servers can be a nightmare & difficult to switch over during a
            disaster. Time and money both will be spent in abundance and the
            constant need to take and maintain backups will hit you hard in the
            on-premise model
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            <b>• Maintenance -</b> The servers are offsite and maintained by a
            cloud provider, hence you need not have to worry about administering
            and maintaining them! As a managed cloud provider, we pro-actively
            manage everything for you. All the updates including security
            patches will be handled by the managed cloud provider which will
            save you lots of time and money.
          </p>

          <p class="card-text">
            <b>• No hardware costs -</b> Storing data onsite comes with the
            baggage of buying and maintaining the servers which have long term
            financial consequences to your organisation and stifles the pace of
            innovation. Adopting the cloud takes away such tasks leaving you to
            concentrate on what matters most - the growth of your business.
          </p>

          <p class="card-text">
            <b>• Work from anywhere Cloud -</b> enables you to access the data
            and update it from anywhere in the world. This is especially
            beneficial to businesses that have employees and branches in
            different parts of the world working on the same project. They can
            easily access, update and save the files on the cloud from any
            location without any hurdles.
          </p>

          <p class="card-text">
            <b>• Security - </b>Lost or corrupted hardware will no longer be a
            problem. You will be able to access data in the cloud no matter what
            happens to your machines. Imagine you lose your laptop, the cost of
            the sensitive data in it will probably be more than the cost of
            itself. Security is step zero at Ecomm India Cloud IT. Step 1
            doesn't take place till security is implemented.
          </p>

          <p class="card-text">
            <b>• Competitiveness -</b> Small businesses cannot keep endlessly
            buying their own servers beyond a certain limit due to financial
            constrains and hence reflects in the performance of their
            applications and lose out to the competition. Migrating to the cloud
            levels the playing field and will give you the freedom to take on
            much larger organization. We as a managed cloud service provider
            enable small businesses to make that transition to the cloud.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            <b>• Environment friendly -</b> This may not seem like a benefit
            from a business point of view but it does matter! Unlike physical
            servers, cloud servers scale up and down depending on demand and
            thus do not consume more energy than they need, resulting in a lower
            carbon footprint and a clearer conscience for you!
          </p>
          <h3>Challenges</h3>

          <p class="card-text">
            Despite all the benefits, cloud migration also has a number of
            challenges associated with it. Organisations need to be mindful of
            these when they decide to take the plunge.
          </p>

          <p class="card-text">
            <b>• Data security -</b> This is one the biggest mental roadblocks
            that makes business leaders fear cloud migration. They feel
            sensitive data is put at risk when you migrate to the cloud from
            physical servers that they can touch and feel. This is a myth has
            been debunked over time. Data on the cloud is probably as secure if
            not more secure with the right architecture than your own premises
            environment.
          </p>

          <p class="card-text">
            <b>• Potential latency</b> Some operations may suffer from added
            delay if the data is in the cloud as opposed to physical servers
            which are directly connected to the machines locally. This can be
            overcome by using cloud providers that have data centers that are
            closer to your physical location.
          </p>

          <p class="card-text">
            <b>• Portability </b>The data or software to be migrated needs to be
            portable with cloud environments. Different environments have
            different needs and it's vital to adapt your data to the needs of
            each one.
          </p>

          <p class="card-text">
            <b>• Adaptability -</b> An organisation moving to the cloud will
            also undergo other changes. Employees will need to adapt to using
            the cloud, security will need to be refurbished and funding will
            also have to be re-distributed according to the new needs. All of
            this will be challenging as it will impact the business directly.
          </p>

          <p class="card-text">
           <b>• Time -</b> Organisations need to carefully consider the time involved in moving data to the cloud and assess the readiness and business deadlines.
          </p>

          <p class="card-text">
            <b>• Cost - </b>Even though the cloud saves the cost of physical servers the cost of migrating data should not to be neglected.
           </p>
